<h1>Evanto Package Labels </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a Python script that walks the user through the Exploratory Data Analysis of Evanto Package Labels sold over 10 years. This project utilizes Natural Language Procession (NLP) libraries in python in addition to maths and stats libraries. This project aims at answering the question of the most popular names/words in the package designs and the sales associated with different words used on different package labels.<br />

This dataset is from Kaggle. It provides insights into digital packaging label designs sold on Envato Market. It contains over 500 rows of structured data on graphic design templates for packaging including product URLs, titles, average ratings, number of sales, prices, date published, date updated, and more. It can be a valuable asset for training machine learning models to generate new packaging visuals, make label recommendations, or classify attributes. Beyond just label details, the dataset provides a window into the digital marketplace for graphic design assets and its interplay with packaging needs in the physical world.<br>

**Objectives of the project** 

This notebook analyzes trends in package design on GraphicRiver.com. The goal is to identify popular niches and attributes of best-selling package templates.

The analysis will:

- Determine which package design styles and themes have the highest sales

- Explore factors driving demand such as color schemes, fonts, and graphic elements

- Identify key insights and patterns among top-performing designs

- Outline opportunities to create new package templates that align with current market trends

The notebook will synthesize data to provide data-backed recommendations for creating commercially successful package designs within GraphicRiver's guidelines and respecting designers' intellectual property rights.
